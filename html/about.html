        <p>
            Solve it! was born when it was felt that there was a need for a place where people could just come after trying to solve a puzzle for a long time, and get the solution with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, We hope that when you come to our site with a problem, you go back satisfied with the solution and a love for some other game which you found in our site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join us on this journey of exploration and problem-solving. Whether you're a novice or an experienced puzzle enthusiast, we have something for everyone.
