This project is a part of JWoC 2024!!

Solve it! is a website, where people can find solvers for various popular games like Sudoku, Nonogram, Crossword etc.

They just need to enter the valid values of the problem, and the the solver would solve the problem and provide the solution.

For Example, if someone wants to solve  a 4x4 sudoku, they just need to input the given digits in the website grid, and then hit submit to get the solution.
The Website is currently hosted at:https://solve-it-self.vercel.app/

The github repository is:https://github.com/Spandan-Bhattacharya/Solve_it

The website is intentionally kept in such a bare-bones state, to help the mentees, especially those just starting their Open-source Journey, take their first steps in the field!!

Website design inspired from fix-your-nums, a great project from JWoC 2023 by Srijita Mandal.
